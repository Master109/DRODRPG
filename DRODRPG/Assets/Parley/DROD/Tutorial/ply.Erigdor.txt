Erigdor is a medium sized city, inhabited by many people. A lot of them are proud that the city has been standing as long as they could remember. Unlike most cities, the atmosphere is one where people don't talk much to others, many of them hard at work with their high-paying jobs. On the other hand, the crime rate is slightly high compared to most cities, due to a lack of many law-enforcers.
