Journey to Erigdor
Before you started that horrible tutorial, your character's village was attacked by a humongous army. You are the only escapee and you are traveling to the nearest city, Erigdor to warn the king and start a new life. You don't have a map, but you know Erigdor is almost exactly north of your current location.



- Go north to Erigdor
- Warn king
